    title Evolution of Industrial Robotics to General Purpose Systems

    1980s-1990s : Traditional Industrial Robots
                 : Isolated cells
                 : Static tasks
                 : Heavy industry focus

    2000s : Rise of Cobots
          : Human collaboration
          : Safety features
          : Flexible programming

    2010s : Mobile Robotics Era
          : AGVs in warehouses
          : Drones (DJI dominance)
          : China's automation surge

    2015 : Made in China 2025
         : Strategic robotics focus
         : 40% to 70% localization goal

    2020-2023 : AI Foundation Models
              : Data scarcity solutions
              : Simulated training
              : China 276K units/year

    2024-2025 : General Purpose Emergence
              : Unitree G1 ($16K)
              : Mass production begins
              : Lights-out factories

    2025-2027 : Projected Revolution
              : Full automation potential
              : China's strategic engine
              : Western wake-up call
```

## Key Insights
- The progression shows an acceleration in recent years, particularly after 2015 with China's strategic initiatives
- The cost reduction from ~$100K-200K humanoids to Unitree's $16K G1 represents a massive leap in accessibility
- The timeline reveals how China positioned itself during the 2010s to capture the 2020s robotics boom
