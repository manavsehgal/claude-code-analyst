    title LLM Architecture Evolution: From GPT to State-of-the-Art

    2017 : Original GPT Architecture
         : Transformer foundation
         : Self-attention mechanism

    2019 : GPT-2 & Early Scaling
         : 1.5B parameters
         : Unsupervised pre-training

    2020 : GPT-3 Era
         : 175B parameters
         : Few-shot learning emergence

    2022 : Efficiency Innovations
         : Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) adoption
         : Sparse models for efficiency

    2023 : Attention Optimizations
         : Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)
         : Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)
         : Sliding Window Attention

    2024 : Modern Architectures
         : DeepSeek-V3 (671B total, 37B active)
         : Advanced normalization techniques
         : Hybrid attention mechanisms
         : 85% parameter reduction during inference
```

## Key Insights
- Seven years post-GPT, core transformer architecture remains foundational
- Major innovations focus on computational efficiency rather than fundamental redesign
- MoE architecture enables massive scale with manageable inference costs
- Attention mechanism optimizations provide 25-75% memory savings
