[x] Scaffold a minimal Python project structure with scripts/ folder where Python scripts will reside, tests/ folder for tests, docs/ folder for user guides. The project is managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python virtual environment and dependencies management
    **Completed**: Initialized uv project with `pyproject.toml` configured for claude-code-analyst (Python >=3.13). Created required directory structure: scripts/, tests/, docs/. Project now has proper Python project scaffolding with uv managing virtual environment and dependencies.

[ ] Read [Claude Code best practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) and write a minimal CLAUDE.md file for the project
