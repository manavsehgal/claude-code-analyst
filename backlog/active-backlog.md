# Active Backlog

[x] Scaffold a minimal Python project structure with scripts/ folder where Python scripts will reside, tests/ folder for tests, docs/ folder for user guides. The project is managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python virtual environment and dependencies management
    **Completed**: Initialized uv project with `pyproject.toml` configured for claude-code-analyst (Python >=3.13). Created required directory structure: scripts/, tests/, docs/. Project now has proper Python project scaffolding with uv managing virtual environment and dependencies.

[x] Read [Claude Code best practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) and write a minimal CLAUDE.md file for the project
    **Completed**: Reviewed Claude Code best practices from the official documentation. Created CLAUDE.md file with essential configuration including: common commands (development setup, linting, type checking), project structure overview, code style guidelines following PEP 8, testing instructions using pytest, repository etiquette, and developer environment setup requirements (Python >=3.13, uv package management).

[x] Create an article_to_md Python script to perform following actions: 
1. take a HTML web page url as input and scrapes the main article
2. check this is a valid HTML and respect robots.txt when scraping
3. ignore everything else including navigation, sidebar, footer, ads
4. create a destination folder markdown/kebab-case-title/
5. convert the scraped article as valid markdown which is well-formatted like original source 
6. save the markdown in the destination folder
7. download images within the article, save in images/ folder wihin destination folder
8. embed the relative references to the images within the markdown in same place as in the original source
    **Completed**: Created `scripts/article_to_md.py` script with full functionality for converting web articles to markdown. Implemented using readability-lxml for article extraction, beautifulsoup4 for HTML parsing, markdownify for markdown conversion, and requests for web scraping. The script respects robots.txt, validates HTML, extracts main article content, creates kebab-case directories, downloads images to an images/ subfolder, and properly embeds relative image references in the markdown. Added necessary dependencies to pyproject.toml: requests, beautifulsoup4, markdownify, and readability-lxml. Script tested successfully with example.com.

[x] Update article_to_md script to add metadata to markdown including article date if available, date scraped, article length in words, number of images, source url, article title. Article should have a level 1 heading matching the title.
    **Completed**: Enhanced scripts/article_to_md.py to include comprehensive metadata in YAML frontmatter format. Added extract_article_date() function that checks multiple meta tags (article:published_time, datePublished, etc.) and time tags for publication dates. Implemented word counting functionality with count_words(). Modified process_images() to return image count. Updated main function to collect all metadata (title, source URL, article date if available, scraping date, word count, image count) and format it as YAML frontmatter at the top of the markdown file. Added the article title as a level 1 heading after the metadata. Enhanced console output to display word count and image count statistics. Tested successfully with example.com.

[x] Make the article_to_md script available as a tool use for Claude Code by updating CLAUDE.md crisply and referencing docs/article-to-md-guide.md if required.
    **Completed**: Added "Available Tools" section to CLAUDE.md with comprehensive documentation for the article_to_md script. Updated docs/article-to-md-guide.md to include new metadata features (YAML frontmatter with title, source URL, article date, scrape date, word count, and image count). The tool is now properly documented and available for Claude Code usage with clear usage examples and reference to the detailed guide.

[x] Update the scripts/article_to_md.py to not add extra newlines to wrap text in markdown and only follow the HTML formatting to decide when to add newlines.
    **Completed**: Removed artificial text wrapping from the markdownify conversion by eliminating `wrap=True` and `wrap_width=80` parameters from the `md()` function call in `convert_to_markdown()`. The script now preserves natural text flow based on HTML structure rather than forcing line breaks at fixed character widths. Verified with example.com that text now flows naturally without arbitrary wrapping, maintaining readability while respecting the original HTML formatting for newline placement.

[x] Study the custom slash command .claude/commands/mermaid.md to add its definition to CLAUDE.md as a custom tool that is available to Claude Code
    **Completed**: Reviewed the mermaid custom command definition in .claude/commands/mermaid.md. Added comprehensive documentation to CLAUDE.md under "Available Tools" section, describing it as "Mermaid Visualization Generator (Custom Command)". Documented its features including: analyzing markdown content, creating multiple Mermaid.js diagrams (flowcharts, timelines, mindmaps), organizing output in mermaid/kebab-case-title/ folders, and including contextual text with visualizations. Provided usage syntax (/mermaid <markdown-file-path>) and detailed the 5-step automatic process the command follows.

[x] Update scripts/article_to_md.py to also work with downloaded html path as source.
    **Completed**: Enhanced article_to_md.py script to accept both URLs and local HTML file paths as input. Added is_url() function to detect input type and read_local_html() function to read local files. Modified main() function to handle both cases - URLs are fetched via HTTP while local files are read directly from disk. The script automatically skips robots.txt check for local files and properly handles relative/absolute file paths. Updated argument parser to accept "source" parameter instead of "url" with updated help text. Tested successfully with both URL inputs (maintains existing functionality) and local HTML files (new functionality). The script now works seamlessly with both web articles and downloaded HTML files.

[x] Update CLAUDE.md and docs/article-to-md-guide.md with revised capabilities of scripts/article_to_md.py to handle local HTML file paths.
    **Completed**: Updated both CLAUDE.md and docs/article-to-md-guide.md to fully document the enhanced capabilities of article_to_md.py. In CLAUDE.md, modified the "Article to Markdown Converter" section to show usage with both web URLs and local HTML files, updated command examples, and enhanced the features list to highlight dual input support and automatic detection. In docs/article-to-md-guide.md, made comprehensive updates including: updated overview and features sections, added separate usage examples for web URLs and local files, changed command-line parameter from "url" to "source", enhanced metadata format documentation, restructured "How It Works" section with input detection and dual content retrieval, added new "Working with Local HTML Files" section covering use cases, file path handling, image processing, and integration with html_downloader.py, updated examples with local file scenarios, enhanced error handling with file-specific errors, added comprehensive batch processing examples for mixed sources, and updated limitations section to distinguish between web and local file constraints. Both documentation files now provide complete guidance for using the enhanced script with either web articles or local HTML files.

[x] Create a script scripts/mermaid_to_image.py which takes a markdown with mermaid script as input and outputs a high fidelity image based on the mermaid visualization. Create a `config.yml` config file with user configurable defaults like height, width, dpi, destination folder for the images. Use visualizations/ folder as default. Traverse parent folder of the source mermaid markdown file and create folder with same name under image destination folder. If the source markdown has multiple mermaid visualizations then create multiple images. Name the images based on the source markdown file name appending -01, -02, -03 suffix sequentially if multiple visualizations found in same source file. Before creating the script research best image formats and conversion libraries for this task which yield highest quality images efficiently.
    **Completed**: Researched and implemented a superior local Mermaid rendering solution using the official Mermaid CLI via mermaid-mcp for professional-grade image generation. Created scripts/mermaid_to_image.py with full functionality for converting Mermaid diagrams to PNG, SVG, and PDF formats using the mature, battle-tested mmdc (Mermaid CLI) tool. The script features intelligent diagram type inference, automatic handling of all Mermaid diagram types (flowcharts, timelines, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, etc.), and configurable output settings. Created config.yml with user-configurable defaults for dimensions (1920x1080), themes (default, dark, forest, neutral, base), background colors, and timeout settings. Implemented proper directory structure matching source file locations (visualizations/parent-folder-name/), sequential filename generation (basename-01.png, basename-02.svg, etc.), comprehensive dependency checking, and robust error handling. Added mermaid-mcp dependency to pyproject.toml and tested successfully with multiple diagram types and formats. This approach is superior to browser automation as it uses the official Mermaid toolchain, providing more reliable rendering, better compatibility, and professional quality output suitable for documentation and presentations. Requires npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli as system dependency.

[x] Fix HTML downloader to properly capture Substack article images wrapped in anchor tags
    **Completed**: Fixed the HTML downloader script's image extraction functionality to properly capture Substack-specific image patterns. Substack wraps images in anchor tags with class="image-link" where the actual image URLs are in the href attributes. Updated the find_images_in_content() function in scripts/html_downloader.py to additionally search for anchor tags with class="image-link" and extract their href attributes as image URLs. The fix now successfully downloads all images from Substack articles (31 images downloaded from the test article compared to 0 previously). The enhanced function checks for various image file extensions (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .webp) and the substackcdn.com domain to ensure only actual images are captured from these anchor tags.

[x] Fix HTML downloader to convert Substack anchor-wrapped images to proper img tags for markdown conversion
    **Completed**: Enhanced the update_image_references() function in scripts/html_downloader.py to properly convert Substack's anchor-wrapped images (class="image-link") into actual <img> tags with local image references. The function now not only updates existing <img> tags but also finds anchor tags with class="image-link" that reference downloaded images and replaces them with proper <img> tags pointing to the local images. This ensures that when article_to_md.py processes the HTML, it finds proper <img> tags and can successfully extract and copy all images. Tested with a Substack article containing 31 images - all images are now properly converted to markdown with local image references preserved.

[x] Install timeout, ruff, and other tools you use frequently to test Python scripts. Add these to CLAUDE.md
    **Completed**: Installed and configured comprehensive Python development toolset as dev dependencies in pyproject.toml. Added ruff (v0.8.4+) for fast linting with 120-char line length configuration, black (v24.11.0+) for consistent code formatting, mypy (v1.14.1+) for static type checking, pytest (v8.3.5+) with pytest-timeout (v2.3.1+) for testing with 300s default timeout, and ipdb (v0.13.13+) for interactive debugging. Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive documentation including "Code Quality Tools" section with usage examples for all tools, "Development Tools" section listing all installed tools with versions and descriptions, and enhanced "Development Setup" section with dev dependency installation commands. All tools tested successfully - ruff detects import issues, black identifies formatting needs, mypy performs type checking, and pytest runs with timeout support.

[x] The apps/ folder will contain vibe coded single page Streamlit apps. All apps will be using headless Claude Code SDK for agent capabilities. Create an apps/agent/ package for reusable capabilities for these apps by researcching the following capabilities, samples, and docs:
- Headless mode Claude Code
    - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk/sdk-python
    - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk/sdk-headless
- Subagents
    - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
- MCP servers
    - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp
- Install options
    - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/amazon-bedrock
    - https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11145838-using-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan
    - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart
    **Completed**: Created comprehensive `apps/` folder structure with `apps/agent/` package containing reusable Claude Code SDK capabilities. Researched and documented all requested features including headless mode, Python SDK, subagents, MCP servers, and installation options. Implemented 5 core modules: `client.py` (ClaudeAgent for headless interactions), `session.py` (SessionManager for conversation persistence), `tools.py` (ToolManager with 6 predefined profiles), `mcp.py` (MCPServer for MCP connections), and `subagents.py` (SubAgentManager with 6 built-in specialized agents). Created `example_chat.py` demonstrating Streamlit integration with agent capabilities. Added streamlit and claude-code-sdk dependencies to pyproject.toml. Documented everything in apps/README.md and updated CLAUDE.md with new capabilities. The package enables building AI-powered Streamlit apps with flexible tool permissions, session management, and specialized task delegation through subagents.

[x] There are three ways Claude Code can authorize access 1) via Anthropic API is environment settings, 2) via Amazon Bedrock configuration in environment setttings, 3) via Max/Pro account authorization. See prior item for docs on all three options. Update apps/example_chat.py and related apps/agent/ reusable code to check which method is active and indicate this in the UI.
    **Completed**: Created comprehensive authentication detection and management system for Claude Code. Implemented `apps/agent/auth.py` with AuthManager class that automatically detects which of the three authentication methods is active: 1) Anthropic API (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY), 2) Amazon Bedrock (AWS credentials + CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1), or 3) Claude Account (claude login with Pro/Max subscription). Updated ClaudeAgent class to accept AuthManager and automatically apply appropriate configuration. Enhanced example_chat.py UI with dedicated "Authentication Status" section in sidebar showing current method, detailed authentication information, error messages, and configuration instructions for non-authenticated methods. Added refresh button and color-coded status indicators (✅/❌). Updated all documentation in CLAUDE.md and apps/README.md with authentication examples and configuration details. The system provides seamless authentication detection and user-friendly guidance for all three supported authentication methods.

[x] I am already logged in on my Claude Code Max account however I see this - No authentication method detected. Please configure one of: Anthropic API key, Amazon Bedrock, or Claude account login
    **Completed**: Fixed Claude account authentication detection in `apps/agent/auth.py`. The issue was that the authentication logic was trying to use interactive-only slash commands (`/status`, `/doctor`) in headless mode via subprocess, which don't work outside of interactive Claude CLI sessions. Updated authentication detection to use a simple test query (`claude -p "Hi" --output-format text`) instead of slash commands. This approach successfully detects Claude Max/Pro account authentication by testing if basic Claude operations work. The updated logic properly identifies Claude account authentication as `claude_account` method with status showing "Pro or Max (authenticated)" and includes a note that detailed subscription info isn't available in headless mode. Authentication detection now works correctly for all three supported methods: Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Claude Account (Pro/Max).

[x] Instead of checking authentication on apps/example_chat.py loading time do it only when Check Auth button is clicked.
    **Completed**: Modified `apps/example_chat.py` to defer authentication checking until user interaction. Added `auth_status` to session state initialized as `None` to track whether authentication has been checked. Updated `render_sidebar()` function to show an info message "Click 'Check Auth Status' to verify your authentication configuration" when authentication hasn't been checked yet. Replaced automatic `detect_auth_method()` call with user-initiated checking via "🔍 Check Auth Status" button. Added loading spinners for better UX during authentication checks. The "🔄 Refresh Auth Status" button now only appears after initial authentication check. This change improves app startup performance by avoiding potentially slow authentication checks on every page load, giving users control over when to verify their authentication status.

[x] When processing response in apps/example_chat.py add a simple animated progress indicator until the response renders.
    **Completed**: Implemented simple animated progress indicator using Streamlit's native `st.spinner()` context manager in `apps/example_chat.py`. The progress indicator displays "🤔 Thinking..." with an animated spinner while the Claude agent processes the user's query. The spinner automatically appears when the query starts processing and disappears when the response is ready to display. This provides immediate visual feedback to users that their request is being processed, improving the user experience by eliminating the blank wait period that previously occurred between submitting a prompt and receiving a response. The implementation uses Streamlit's built-in spinner functionality which is reliable, well-tested, and integrates seamlessly with the existing async query processing workflow.

[x] Rename apps/example_chat.py as apps/chat.py
    **Completed**: Successfully renamed `apps/example_chat.py` to `apps/chat.py` to provide a cleaner, more concise filename. Updated all references across the codebase including: CLAUDE.md command examples (`uv run streamlit run apps/chat.py`), apps/README.md file structure listing and usage instructions, and comment text to reflect the simplified naming. Cleaned up associated cached files (`__pycache__/example_chat.cpython-313.pyc`) to prevent any import conflicts. The renamed file maintains all functionality including Streamlit chat interface, authentication management, progress indicators, and Claude Code SDK integration. All syntax validation passed and the application is ready to run with the new filename.

[x] Create docs/chat.md based on apps/README.md and remove the readme file.
    **Completed**: Successfully created comprehensive documentation at `docs/chat.md` based on the content from `apps/README.md`. The new documentation covers the Claude Code Agent Chat application and all underlying agent package components including ClaudeAgent, SessionManager, ToolManager, AuthManager, SubAgentManager, and MCPServer with complete usage examples and configuration instructions. Enhanced the documentation with improved structure, added overview section, detailed chat application features, and technical notes about progress indicators and authentication optimization. Removed `apps/README.md` file to consolidate documentation in the central `docs/` directory. The documentation is properly formatted with markdown structure, accessible at 7,072 bytes, and provides complete guidance for using the chat application and building custom applications with the agent package.

[x] Remove the message "Click 'Check Auth Status' to verify your authentication configuration" below the "Check Auth Status" button. There is also no need for "Refresh Auth Status" button as clicking check auth status button will refresh.
    **Completed**: Simplified authentication UI in `apps/chat.py` by removing redundant elements. Removed the info message "Click 'Check Auth Status' to verify your authentication configuration" that appeared when auth status hadn't been checked (line 61). Eliminated the "Refresh Auth Status" button and its associated logic (lines 107-111) since clicking the "Check Auth Status" button already performs a refresh. The authentication section now has a cleaner interface with a single "Check Auth Status" button that handles both initial checking and refreshing. Syntax validation passed and the streamlined UI maintains all functionality while reducing visual clutter and user confusion.

[x] Remove scripts/10k_tech.py script, dependencies, and any references in backlog, docs, readme, claude.md, or elsewhere in this project
    **Completed**: Successfully removed all traces of the scripts/10k_tech.py script and related components from the project. Deleted the main script file (scripts/10k_tech.py). Analyzed dependencies and determined that all packages used by 10k_tech.py (requests, beautifulsoup4, markdownify, readability-lxml, pyyaml) are still needed by other scripts (article_to_md.py, html_downloader.py, mermaid_to_image.py), so no dependencies were removed from pyproject.toml. Removed the complete "SEC 10-K Technology Analyzer" section from CLAUDE.md documentation (lines 199-234) including usage examples, features list, and tool description. Cleaned up the 10k_tech configuration section from config.yml (lines 50-131) removing all SEC API settings, section patterns, and filtering rules. Removed generated output folders containing 10-K filings (markdown/walmart/, markdown/walmart-inc/, markdown/wmt/, markdown/microsoft/, markdown/meta/) that were created by the script. Verified no remaining references to 10k_tech exist in the project. The project is now fully cleaned of the 10k_tech functionality while preserving all other tools and their dependencies.
