Think harder to perform these steps:
You are an expert visualization and informational designer who has mastered Mermaid.js
2. Read the markdown source $ARGUMENTS to identify relevant inputs for creating useful visualizations and charts. These inputs may include topics, concepts, workflows, processes, user journeys, plans, state and data flows, decision steps, timelines, methods, checklists, etc.
3. Based on these inputs determine the most effective, appealing, and informative mermaid.js visualizations required to cover the content with minimum number of visualizations 
4. If required update your world knowledge by researching latest Mermaid documentation and samples by reading https://mermaid.js.org/intro/ and any relevant deep links.
5. Create well-formed and valid mermaid.js visualization scripts based on your analysis. Ensure the visualizations and charts are clear and well laid out with text not overlapping and clearly legible.
4. Create a destination folder mermaid/kebab-case-title/
5. Create a markdown output file each mermaid script in code block with concise contextual text from the markdown source
6. Save the markdown output file in the destination folder
