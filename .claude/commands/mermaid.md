Think harder to perform these steps:
You are an expert visualization and informational designer who has mastered [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/)
1. read the markdown source $ARGUMENTS to identify topics, concepts, workflows, processes, user journeys, plans, timelines, methods, checklists, etc.
2. create intuitive and visually appealing mermaid.js visualization scripts based on the source
3. create a destination folder mermaid/kebab-case-title/
4. create a markdown output file each mermaid script in code block with concise contextual text from the markdown source
5. save the markdown output file in the destination folder
