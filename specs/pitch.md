Think harder.
1. Develop a Streamlit app apps/proposal.py
2. The app will create a custom proposal for a customer
3. It will lookup companies/ folder to list available companies
4. Once company is selected it will list the content available for the company under companies/company-name/
5. User can multi-select the content to use in building a pitch
6. User can also select the sections of the proposal document
    - Identify customer problems and pain points
    - Identify customer explicit asks
    - Discover customer latent needs (unsaid, unmet needs)
    - Impact analysis if problems, asks, needs are met
    - 
7. User can then click generate pitch which will use the content
