You are an expert at Streamlit app development and Claude Code SDK. You are building a single page app apps/proposal.py in Streamit based on the following specification. Think harder to build this app as an agent based system.

Use Claude Code SDK https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk/sdk-python effectively for LLM agent capabilities.

Learn about building effective agents by reading markdown/building-effective-ai-agents-anthropic/article.md article.

The app helps user generate a proposal matching company needs with AWS AI offerings.
Information about AWS AI offerings is available in projects/llm-architectures-on-aws/report-03.md file.

List companies available in companies/ folder for the user to select one to target the proposal.

User can then select one or many of the proposal sections:
- Executive Summary: What is the elevator pitch and summary of the rest of the document?
- Problem Statement: What are the problems, pain points, explicit asks, and latent needs of the company?
- Industry Trends: Which industry trends are relevant for the company growth?
- Competition: What are competitors doing which may need a response from the company?
- Market Segments: Which market segments is the company serving and what are the opportunity gaps to address these markets?
- Technology Strategy: What are the technologies company is using or developing and what is their strategy?
- AWS AI Services: Which AWS AI services match company's needs and why?
- Adoption Plan: What is the recommended timeline for company to adopt AWS AI services based on their needs and external factors (industry, competition, markets)?
- Spend: Analyze AWS AI services public pricing, predict usage volume based on company needs, propose monthly and annual spend.
- Returns: Create a plan for spend vs returns to illustrate when the company is able to break-even on their AWS spend.

Add check boxes to only use local content (companies/ folder content), use LLM world knowledge, use online research to create the proposal content.

When writing the proposal sections add a score to each section based on extent to which content from companies/ folder was used vs your world knowledge vs online research. Something like Content score: 80% local content, 10% world knowledge, 10% online research.

Create the most optiminal agent/subagent strategy to generate the proposal. Based on the selected proposal sections create subagents to write content for these sections. Create a progress indicator UI to show progress of each subagent. Compile the sections, format the proposal, and save it in the proposals/company-name/proposal-yyyy-mm-dd.md file.

IMPORTANT: These instructions may be revised and rerun to update existing app. Note incremental changes in changelog. Note any open [ ] issues and fix these.

# Issues

[x] Error generating proposal: name 'progress_bar' is not defined

[x] Instead of using the sidebar use main content area for all the features of the app. Smartly show/hide sections and scroll to active section as user progresses in the UI.

[x] Error generating proposal: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'PosixPath' and 'NoneType'

[x] Even after selecting a company I get this error - No company selected. Please go back and select a company.

[x] See this error in the generate proposal - Error generating competition analysis: can only concatenate str (not "SystemMessage") to str

[x] Agent processing is taking a long time and seems to be stuck after starting the second agent. Why are multiple subagents not run in parallel where allowed by best practices and Claude Code SDK? Why does progress not go through agent stages like starting, active, complete, error, etc.

[x] I am seeing whole bunch of agents in pending state with no progress for some time. Are you using Claude Code SDK correctly and setting up subagents as per best practices? Read following docs to learn:
