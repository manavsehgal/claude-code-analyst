## Review

1. **Section:** *Inference Configuration for DeepSeek-V3*
   **Excerpt:** “**AWS Inference Deployment Configuration** … **Compute**: inf2.8xlarge (for **20B+ active parameters**) … **Caching**: **ElastiCache Redis for KV cache** and **expert weights**.”&#x20;
   **Issue:** An **inf2.8xlarge** has **one Inferentia2 accelerator with 32 GB HBM**—insufficient for >20B active params at bfloat16 (≈40 GB just for weights), absent heavy quantization/sharding. Also, **KV cache** lives on-device (GPU/accelerator) or host DRAM/NVMe via paged/offloaded KV; **remote Redis adds too much latency**.
   **Correction:** Use **inf2.24xlarge/48xlarge** (more accelerators) or P5/P5e for 20B+ active params, and keep KV cache **on accelerator/host memory** (e.g., vLLM’s paged/offloaded KV). Use Redis/ElastiCache **for response/result caching**, not KV cache or expert weights. Sources: AWS inf2 instance specs (1 chip/32 GB on inf2.8xlarge) and KV-offload guidance. ([AWS Static][1], [Reddit][2], [BentoML][3], [Medium][4])

2. **Section:** *Mixture-of-Experts Serving*
   **Excerpt:** “**Expert Caching Strategy:** **Amazon ElastiCache Redis** clusters for frequently accessed experts … **Cold Expert Storage:** **S3 with millisecond retrieval** for infrequently accessed experts.”&#x20;
   **Issue:** Serving **experts over networked Redis/S3 at inference time** is **too slow**; expert weights should be **local** (disk/NVMe) or pre-loaded to device. S3 retrieval is not “millisecond” at the granularity required for hot inference paths.
   **Correction:** Keep experts **on local NVMe/EBS** and **pre-load** active experts; use S3 only for **artifact storage** outside the hot path. For caching, use Redis to cache **responses**, not weights/KV. ([Reddit][2], [Medium][4])

3. **Section:** *Inference Scaling Patterns*
   **Excerpt (table row):** “**235B MoE (22B active)** → **inf2.8xlarge**.”&#x20;
   **Issue:** As above, **inf2.8xlarge** (32 GB) is **not viable** for **22B active** in bf16 without extreme quantization/sharding beyond what the line implies.
   **Correction:** Replace with **inf2.48xlarge** (multiple accelerators) or **P5e/P5**; note quantization/sharding assumptions explicitly. ([AWS Static][1])

4. **Section:** *Kendra GenAI Index*
   **Excerpt:** “**Automated embedding model selection and dimension tuning** …”&#x20;
   **Issue:** AWS docs describe Kendra GenAI Index as reducing RAG plumbing and integrating with Bedrock/Kendra; they **don’t document auto model selection or dimensionality tuning**.
   **Correction:** Rephrase to: “Managed retrieval that **reduces RAG setup** and integrates with Bedrock; **embedding choice/dimensions are not auto-tuned** by the service per public docs.” ([AWS Documentation][5])

5. **Section:** *Advanced Inference Optimization (re\:Invent 2024)*
   **Excerpt:** “**Bedrock Prompt Caching … Up to 90% cost reduction** … ‘**Intelligent Prompt Routing … 30% cost reduction**.’”&#x20;
   **Issue:** These **specific % savings aren’t published** by AWS. Prompt/response caching can reduce latency/cost, but **% depends on reuse patterns**; “automatic routing” is **not a Bedrock runtime feature**—it’s something customers implement (AgentCore announced later helps agent ops, not generic cross-model auto-routing).
   **Correction:** Remove fixed %; say “can **significantly** cut latency/cost when prompts repeat” and note that **routing logic is application-level** (AgentCore helps with agents). ([Portkey][6], [About Amazon][7])

6. **Section:** *Model Distillation on Bedrock*
   **Excerpt:** “**500% faster inference** … **75% cheaper** … **through **Bedrock** automation**.”&#x20;
   **Issue:** Amazon Bedrock does **not** offer a **managed distillation** product with guaranteed speed/cost multipliers.
   **Correction:** Replace with: “Consider **knowledge distillation** using **SageMaker** or external tooling; Bedrock supports **fine-tuning/hosting**, but **no managed distillation** with guaranteed multipliers.” ([AWS Documentation][8])

7. **Section:** *Amazon Q Developer – Industry Benchmarks*
   **Excerpt:** “**SWE-bench accuracy (Verified)**: **54.8%** … **leaderboard top 1–3 in 2025**.”&#x20;
   **Issue:** Public **SWE-bench** leaderboards list top scores (e.g., GPT-5/Claude 4) in the mid-60s; AWS marketing says Q Developer achieved “**highest scores**,” but **no official 54.8%** is published.
   **Correction:** Remove the numeric claim; cite AWS page (“highest scores”) and the **SWE-bench** leaderboard instead. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][9], [SWE-bench][10])

8. **Section:** *Apple Integration (Customer Success Stories)*
   **Excerpt:** “**Global Inference:** Apple Intelligence features **powered by AWS global infrastructure** … **Trainium2** improves Apple pre-training efficiency **50%**.”&#x20;
   **Issue:** **Apple Intelligence** runs on-device and on **Apple’s Private Cloud Compute with Apple silicon**, not “AWS global inference.” Apple has said it **uses AWS** (Graviton/Inferentia) for **parts of its AI/ML lifecycle** and is **evaluating Trainium2**, but the **‘global inference on AWS’** and **“50%”** figures are **not supported** by Apple/AWS public docs.
   **Correction:** “Apple uses **PCC (Apple silicon)** for Apple Intelligence server-side processing; Apple also **leverages AWS** for certain AI/ML workloads and has discussed **Trainium2** evaluation.” ([Apple Security Research][11], [Apple][12], [DataCenterDynamics][13], [Reuters][14], [9to5Mac][15])

9. **Section:** *Trainium2 General Availability*
   **Excerpt:** “**30–40% better price performance than GPU instances**.”&#x20;
   **Issue:** **No AWS source** publishes a flat **30–40%** price-performance delta vs “GPU instances.”
   **Correction:** Remove fixed %; cite official Trainium2 announcements without numeric cross-GPU claims, or qualify as **anecdotal** if you have an internal benchmark.

10. **Section:** *Trainium2 Ultra Servers*
    **Excerpt:** “**64 Trainium2 chips in single node (83 PF)** … **Single-node deployment for trillion-parameter models**.”&#x20;
    **Issue:** AWS/press confirm **64-chip Trainium2 servers**; however, claiming a **single node supports ‘trillion-parameter’ training** is **speculative**—actual capacity depends on **parallelism, precision, activation memory, optimizer states**, etc.
    **Correction:** “AWS announced **64-chip Trainium2** servers; suitability for **trillion-param** training depends on **distributed setup**.” ([Reuters][14])

11. **Section:** *Aurora DSQL – “Revolutionary Database Architecture”*
    **Excerpt:** “**4× faster reads/writes than Google Spanner** … **Postgres Compatibility: Seamless migration**.”&#x20;
    **Issue:** AWS **does not publish** a “**4× vs Spanner**” claim. Also, although DSQL is **PostgreSQL-compatible**, there are **feature differences** and **migration gotchas** documented by community posts/issues.
    **Correction:** “State DSQL benefits (serverless distributed SQL, **multi-Region strong consistency**, **99.999%** multi-Region availability) without cross-vendor perf claims; call out **compatibility differences** and migration planning.” ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][16], [AWS Documentation][17], [Yugabyte][18], [GitHub][19])

12. **Section:** *P6 (NVIDIA Blackwell) – Networking*
    **Excerpt:** “**28.8 Tbps Elastic Fabric Adapter networking** … deployable in **EC2 UltraClusters**.”&#x20;
    **Issue:** AWS docs list **EFA up to 3,200 Gbps (3.2 Tbps) per instance** on P5/P5e; there’s **no public AWS source** for “**28.8 Tbps EFA**.” The huge bandwidth figures you may have seen (e.g., **130 TB/s**) refer to **NVLink inside an NVL72 system**, not EFA.
    **Correction:** Remove “28.8 Tbps EFA”; if you mention intra-system bandwidth, label it **NVLink**, and keep EFA claims to documented values. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][20])

13. **Section:** *Strategic Recommendations – High Priority*
    **Excerpt:** “**Aurora DSQL Migration** … **4× performance improvement**; **S3 Table Buckets Adoption** … **3× query performance**.”&#x20;
    **Issue:** These **multipliers aren’t in AWS docs**; S3 Tables are real, but **3× query gains depend on workload/engine**.
    **Correction:** Replace fixed multipliers with **measured results** from your benchmarks; describe S3 Tables benefits (open-table format on S3, Glue/Athena/Redshift integrations) and link to the **launch**. ([AWS Documentation][21])

14. **Section:** *Bedrock Providers*
    **Excerpt:** “**Providers include** … **OpenAI: GPT models through managed service integration**.”&#x20;
    **Issue:** Needs specificity. As of 2025, **Bedrock offers OpenAI’s *open-weight* GPT-OSS-120B/20B**, **not** proprietary ChatGPT models.
    **Correction:** “**OpenAI (open-weight): GPT-OSS-120B & 20B** available in Bedrock; proprietary GPT-4-class models remain outside Bedrock.” ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][22])

15. **Section:** *GQA/SWA/MLA savings (implicit across the doc)*
    **Excerpt:** e.g., “**MLA … 40–60% KV-cache memory reduction**.”&#x20;
    **Issue:** The **percent figures aren’t sourced**. DeepSeek papers note MLA reduces KV-cache **significantly**, with **DeepSeek-V2 citing \~93%** KV reduction; fixed “40–60%” may **under- or mis-state** savings.
    **Correction:** Cite the model paper(s) and avoid fixed, universal %s: “**MLA reduces KV-cache memory significantly** (DeepSeek reports large reductions; actual savings depend on config).” ([arXiv][23])
