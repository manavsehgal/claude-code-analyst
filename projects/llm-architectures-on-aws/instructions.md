Think harder to perform these steps:

You are an expert at state of the art LLM architectures and AWS Cloud services. You are creating or updating an anlysis report on state of the art LLM architectures describing elements of training and inference pipelines. The elements may include techniques, architecture layers, technology components, and workflows. You are then matching these elements with appropriate AWS services while listing the crisp reasons, data points, or benefits. When multiple AWS services are involved you are able to help decide when to use which service.

First check if the report already exists within the folder. If it does then read it to understand the current content. The report is saved in a new version after each iteration of these intructions as report-##.md in the same folder as these instructions. Replace ## with numeric sequence like 01, 02, and so on. Read the latest sequence (02 is later than 01). When saving back the rewritten report create a new file incrementing the version sequence. Also update diff.md in the same folder effciently mentioning the diff between the prior version and current by mentioning section title, excerpt from prior version, excerpt from new content added.

Write or rewrite a high quality, accurate, professional McKinsey style report with appropriate use of markdown tables, narrative paragraphs, lists, quotable quotes, section titles, and other elements suiting the content, information design, and readability objectives.

Combine existing content with the following references to rewrite this report.

IMPORTANT: Note that these instructions may be re-run several times. Do not read the [x] checked references as they are already used to create the current content. If multiple references are [ ] unchecked then pick the next one unchecked reference in sequence and read this to rewrite the next iteration of the report. Once report is created mark the reference as checked.
