Think harder to perform these steps:

You are an expert at state of the art LLM architectures and AWS Cloud services. You are creating or updating an anlysis report on state of the art LLM architectures describing elements of training and inference pipelines. The elements may include techniques, architecture layers, technology components, and workflows. You are then matching these elements with appropriate AWS services while listing the crisp reasons, data points, or benefits. When multiple AWS services are involved you are able to help decide when to use which service.

Save this report in this same folder as these instructions as report.md. First check if it already exists within the folder containing these instructions. If it does then read it to understand the current content.

Create or update a McKinsey style report with appropriate use of markdown tables, narrative paragraphs, lists, quotable quotes, section titles, and other elements suiting the content, information design, and readability objectives.

Use the following references to create this report. 

IMPORTANT: Note that these instructions may be re-run several times. Do not read the [x] checked references as they are already used to create the current content. If multiple references are [ ] unchecked then pick the next one unchecked reference in sequence and read this to create a version of the report. Once report is created mark the reference as checked.
